subject: Application for Se-Frontend Developer Role 

Dear Neha Sharma,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Shivaji. I am writing to express my interest in the Se-Frontend Developer Role with your Mumbai-based SaaS startup. Though I’m a fresher, I’ve been working with React.js since 2022 and Next.js since 2023, and have built some exciting projects. These experiences have helped me improve my skills in building fast, responsive, and user-friendly applications.

I’m confident that my hands-on experience with React, Next.js, TypeScript and modern web development tools can add value to your team. You can check out my projects and portfolio here.

I believe my skills and projects demonstrate my ability to contribute effectively to your team, and I am excited about the opportunity to work in a fast-paced SaaS environment. Please find my resume attached for further details.

I would love to connect and discuss my application further. Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
